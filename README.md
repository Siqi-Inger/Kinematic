# Kinematic
This project is about how to calculate forward kinematics and inverse kinematics problems.

### forward kinematics
Pre-defined the DH parameters and joint offsets. Calculated the position and orientation of end-effector based on the given parameters and each joints' angles.

### inverse kinematics
Input several sets the position and orientation of end-effector. Calculated each joint's angle by using 1. Jacobian Transpose Method. 2. Pseudoinverse Method. 3. Damped Least Squares Method.
